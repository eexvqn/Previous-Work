```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

```{r, eval=TRUE,echo=TRUE}
x <- c("123",1,2)
as.numeric(x)
```

```{r, eval=TRUE,echo=TRUE}
# Enter code here
library(tidyverse)
gapminder <- read_csv("gapminder.csv")
gapminder

```

```{r, eval=TRUE,echo=TRUE}
# Enter code here
gapminder %>%
  select(country, continent, year)

select(gapminder, country, continent, year)

count(gapminder, country)

```
List only the rows corresponding to Singapore in the decreasing order of their gdpPercap (only code required)
```{r, eval=TRUE,echo=TRUE}
# Enter code here
gapminder %>%
  filter(country == "Singapore") %>%
  arrange(desc(gdpPercap))

```
Find the mean value of life expectancy of Singapore (only code required)
```{r, eval=TRUE,echo=TRUE}
# Enter code here
gapminder %>%
  filter(country == "Singapore") %>%
  summarise(mean(lifeExp))

```

Obtain a plot of Singapore’s population from 1952 to 2007 (only code required)

```{r, eval=TRUE,echo=TRUE}
# Enter code here
A <- gapminder %>%
  filter(country == "Singapore", year >= 1952, year <= 2007)

ggplot(A) +
aes(x=year,y=pop) +
    geom_point() 

```

# Definition of function
```{r, eval=TRUE,echo=TRUE}
# Enter code here


print_updated_value <- function(x,y='100') {
  new_y <- as.numeric(y)
  print(x+new_y)
}

print_updated_value(23)
```


Evaluate the code in RStudio and debug it to obtain the output. Explain what was wrong with the code, what the error-free code does and the reason for the output

```{r, eval=TRUE,echo=TRUE}
multiply <- function(value) {
  
  function_inside_function <- function(multiplier) {
    return(multiplier*value)
  }
  
  return(function_inside_function(10))
  }

multiply(50)
```
```{r, eval=TRUE,echo=TRUE}

function_inside_function <- function(multiplier) {
  return(multiplier*value)
}

function_inside_function(12)
```

Write a function called guessNum for a guessing game where the players must guess the value of a number stored in a variable answer,

a. In the first step, take the user's guess as the argument 

b. In the local scope of guessNum, initialize the value of the variable answer to be 15

c. Compare the user’s guess with the variable answer

d. Print out an appropriate message to the console, telling them if guess was above, below, or right on the number stored in answer

e. In the global scope, initialize the value of a variable guess to be 16. Write the function call for the guessNum function, using guess as the argument.

Only final code is required.
```{r, eval=TRUE,echo=TRUE}

guessNum <- function(guess) {
  ifelse(guess == 15, "You're Right!", 
         ifelse(guess < 15, "Your guess is too low",
                "Your guess is too high"))
}

guessNum(16)
```


## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

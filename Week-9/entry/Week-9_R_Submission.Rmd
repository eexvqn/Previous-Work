## Week 9

Answer the following questions in an R Markdown file,

#### (1) What is the topic that you have finalized? (Answer in 1 or 2 sentences),

The topic I have chosen to finalise on would be on deforestation in Brazil and how agriculture and livestock produce contributed to deforestation.

#### (2) What are the data sources that you have curated so far? (Answer 1 or 2 sentences).

I have decided to use the datasets from Our World in Data and from Climate Watch Data. To be more specific, the datasets I intend to use would be "sugarcane.csv", "soybean.csv", "maize.csv", "cattle.csv", "pigmeat.csv", and "poultry.csv" from Our World in Data and "historical_emissions.csv" from Climate Watch Data.

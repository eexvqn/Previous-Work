Document

Answer the following questions in an R Markdown file,

(1) What is the topic that you have finalized? (Answer in 1 or 2 sentences),

The topic I have chosen to finalise on would be on Deforestation in Brazil and how it affects the food supply. 

(2) What are the data sources that you have curated so far? (Answer 1 or 2 sentences).

The data sources I have curated are as follows:

```{r, eval=TRUE, echo=TRUE}
library(tidytuesdayR)
library(tidyverse)
read_csv("brazil_loss.csv")
soybean_use <- read_csv("soybean_use.csv")
soybean_use %>%
  filter(entity == "Brazil")

vegetable_oil <- read_csv("vegetable_oil.csv")
vegetable_oil %>%
  filter(entity == "Brazil")
```
